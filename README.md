# What's In My Earholes

This project was initially a chance for me to practice a full-stack project that included CRUD functionality. Now that is has that functionality I am wanting to work on a visual design and add auth functionality

The core idea is to list recent albums that you have been listening to and be able to share this with your friends.

## What it currently includes

- Back end database with initial seed information
- Connecttion to the front end with an internal api
- Redux is used to manage the state on the front end
- The user has the ability to view, add, update, and delete albums

## Different ideas I have considered and wanting to work on

- Adding more CSS to the website and making it more visually appealing
- Limiting only being able to list 5 albums. If you add a new one the oldest will disappear. (Still being able to see your own history however)
- Altering the database to allow for different users
- Adding authentication so different people can sign in
- Adding front end to allow the user to view their friend's recent albums and being able to change their own recent albums
